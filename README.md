# UFOs:

## Overview of Project:

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to assist Dana in creating a more in-depth webpage for users. We assissted Dana by creating a a more in depth filter system that allows the users to search for multiple criteria to narrow down the search results. Once we added the additional functionality we used D3 functionality to clean up the website to make it more appealing to the user.

## Results:

### Search Functionality:

Shown above is the search filter we added as part of the challenge. You will use the above fitler to search all the data we have aquired and it will narrow down baesd on Date, City, State, Country, and UFO shape. As part of the functionality of the search tool, we added the ability for the filter as you type in various items in the search tool.

## Summary of the Webpage:

### Drawback:
The major drawback I find is that the filter search does not provide the user with a summary of what can be input into each box. For example, the user will not know what possible shapes the UFOs could be so they could spend time searching for shapes that are not found. 


### Additional Reccomendations:
Shown above is the final website. We used D3 functionality to clean everything up and make it look more appealing to the users. To add additional functionality to the webpage I would like to recommend the following:

(i) A clear function that resets all of the filters. This would make it easier for the user to quickly reset the filters if they are using multiple filter criteria. In addition, the user does not have the ability to filter the search results. For example, say we use the date 1/1/2010 as the Search Filter. The user should be able to organize the results that are provided similar to how you can organize tables in Excel.

(ii) An additional tool box below the filters that quickly allow the user to look at previous searches. This would add the functionality for anybody who uses the website over multiple days for research purposes.
